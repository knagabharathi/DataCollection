This process can range from simple data collection tasks, like scraping prices from an e-commerce site, tomore complex activities, such as harvesting contact information for research purposes.

## Is web scraping legal?
- The legality of web scraping depends on several factors and can vary by country. Generally, scraping publicly accessible data for personal, non-commercial use is considered legal. However, issues arise when scraping:
-- Data behind a login or other access controls.
-- Copyrighted material or proprietary information.
-- Websites with explicit terms of service that prohibit scraping.
It's crucial to respect privacy laws (like GDPR in Europe), adhere to the website's terms of service, and avoid overloading servers.
When in doubt, seeking legal advice or obtaining explicit permission from the website owner is advisable.
